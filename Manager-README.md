## Disclaimers
-  You will find my document may resemble others you encounter online and sometimes looks like a copy & paste, and that’s OK, it just means I couldn’t put it in better words.
-  This is a living document.
-  I intend this to be honest and truthful. I fear this may be an idealized version of myself. 

## Introduction
This document is an introduction to me; a small window into what makes me tick, things you should know about my perception of myself and my role.

## My Role
My role as a manager is to support you, plain and simple. Your success is my success. I will try my best to put you in the best possible position to succeed. It is my goal to provide an environment for you to feel challenged and fulfilled by your work and working relationships. 

I wish to create and maintain a culture of respect, honesty, integrity, and fairness. I will do my best to engage in meaningful interpersonal interactions with you, contributing positively to your morale and career satisfaction.

## Philosophies
My philosophies are subject to change. If my beliefs are proven incorrect, I will change my thinking however difficult that may be for me to accept.

-  I believe in an idea meritocracy. The best idea wins no matter the source.
-  I believe in outcomes over outputs. 
-  I do not believe in micromanaging or top down, command and control leadership. However, I don’t have any specific management style nor do I believe in subscribing to one. I will adapt and do what’s best for the team and the individual.
-  I believe the person in the more senior position is getting paid, partially, to adjust to personality styles of the people reporting to them.
-  We may strongly disagree from time to time and that’s typically okay. I recognize that there is a significant difference between personal conflict (which is unsavory) and task conflict or idea conflict (which is productive). 

## 1:1 Meetings
These meetings help establish a level of trust between us. They are a tool for me to help guide your career development. Think of these meetings as your meetings. Feel free to talk about anything. The default agenda is whatever is on your mind, work related or not. I may have some things I will occasionally want to discuss with you, but these meetings are first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you’re doing, what you need and what you wish could be different. 

I find that having a half hour meeting each week works well. But we can adjust. I like to keep a shared document to capture future topics to discuss. It helps to record notes from the meeting as well to refer back on.

## Communication
There will be times when I may appear too busy to talk. Meetings can be moved around more than you may realize. When meetings are run well, they shouldn’t run for the full allotment of time. So please don’t let my schedule stop you from reaching out. Refer to the “My Job” section above. I am here to support you. I will admit I can be poor about responding to emails on occasion. So, if you need to talk to me, the best way to get my attention is to send me a text. I will make time to respond as quickly as I can. 

## Autonomy and Teamwork
There is a fine line between being able to work well independently and working together as a team toward a common goal. I will encourage and steer your individual performance and productivity. You will be given space to fail, grow and flourish. But we need to balance individual autonomy with the goals of the team. While you, as an individual, may be more productive focusing on your own tasks, you may actually be holding back the team while they wait for you. I find the Agile Penny Game is an interesting demonstration to show why this is. If you don’t know what it is, there are plenty of short youtube videos explaining the concept.

## On Feedback
-  Feedback can be uncomfortable
-  Feedback is critical to your success here, and mine
-  Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:
    -  Safety (unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback; should be high)
    -  Effort (The amount of work in order to give feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?"; should be low)
    -  Benefit (how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? should be high)
-  Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions
-  I'll let you know if you don't do well on any of these three dimensions

## Personality Quirks
-  I might be quiet on occasion. That’s either me thinking deeply or I’m leaving space for others to showcase their ideas and skills.
-  I do not take myself seriously. Life’s too short to get offended. 
-  I sometimes swear too much. But in a casual way, not mean spirited.
-  I tend to write with bullets ... and ellipses … too much.
